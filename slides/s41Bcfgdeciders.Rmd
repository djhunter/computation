# Decidable Languages involving Grammars

## Recall: Context-Free Grammars

A **context-free grammar** is a 4-tuple $(V, \Sigma, R, S)$, where

1. $V$ is a finite set, called the *variables*,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set, disjoint from $V$, called the *terminals*,
3. $R$ is a finite set of *rules*, with each rule of the form $X \rightarrow \mathcal{Q}$, where $X$ is a variable and $\mathcal{Q}$ is a string of variables and terminals.
4. $S \in V$ is the start variable.

The set of all strings of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol $S$ is called the **language of the grammar**. The language of a context-free grammar (CFG) is a **context-free language** (CFL).

## Context-Free Grammar: example

1. $V$ is a finite set, called the *variables*,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set, disjoint from $V$, called the *terminals*,
3. $R$ is a finite set of *rules*, with each rule of the form $X \rightarrow \mathcal{Q}$, where $X$ is a variable and $\mathcal{Q}$ is a string of variables and terminals.
4. $S \in V$ is the start variable.

Example: $V = \{S\}$, $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$, and the rules $R$ are:

\begin{align*}
S & \rightarrow \varepsilon \\
S & \rightarrow \mathtt{0}S\mathtt{1}
\end{align*}

## Chomsky Normal Form

**Theorem.** Any context-free grammar can be rewritten so the rules all have the form $A \rightarrow BC$ or $A \rightarrow x$, where $x$ is a terminal and $A,B,C$ are variables, where $B\neq S$ and $C \neq S$. (We also allow $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$.)

Proof: Add variables as needed, and add rules to maintain the grammar.

. . .

Example: Convert the following to Chomsky Normal Form.

\begin{align*}
S & \rightarrow \varepsilon \\
S & \rightarrow \mathtt{0}S\mathtt{1}
\end{align*}

## Chomsky Normal Form

**Theorem.** Any context-free grammar can be rewritten so the rules all have the form $A \rightarrow BC$ or $A \rightarrow x$, where $x$ is a terminal and $A,B,C$ are variables, where $B\neq S$ and $C \neq S$. (We also allow $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$.)

**Lemma.** If a grammar is expressed in Chomsky normal form, than any derivation of $|w|$ takes $2|w|-1$ steps.

## Theorem: $A_\text{CFG}$ is decidable

$A_\text{CFG} =  \{ \langle G, w\rangle \mid G \text{ is a CFG generating } w\}$

. . .

**Corollary.** Every context-free language is decidable.

## Theorem: $E_\text{CFG}$ is decidable

$E_\text{CFG} = \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \text{ is a CFG and } L(G) = \emptyset \}$

# Countability

## Injectivity (one to one)

- A function $f : X \longrightarrow Y$ is *one-to-one* (or *injective*) if no output is ever repeated.
- In other words, $f(a) = f(b)$ implies that $a = b$.

(example)

## Cardinality and countability

If $X$ is a set, $|X|$ is its *cardinality*.

- For finite sets, $|X|$ is the number of elements in $X$.
- For infinite sets, $|X| \leq |Y|$ if there is an injective function $f: X \longrightarrow Y$.
- Sets whose cardinality does not exceed the cardinality of the natural numbers are called *countable*. So a set is countable if there is an injection $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{N}$.
- Informally, "countable" means you can number the elements.

Examples: $\Sigma^*$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are countable.
