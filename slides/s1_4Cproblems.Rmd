## Pumping Lemma

*Theorem 1.70 (Pumping Lemma).* If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$ (the "pumping length") such that, if $s\in A$ has length at least $p$, then $s = xyz$, where:

1. for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A$,
2. $|y| > 0$, and
3. $|xy| \leq p$.

# Regular vs Nonregular

## How to prove a language is regular

- Build a DFA or an NFA that recognizes it.
- Find a regular expression that describes it.
- Use closure to show that it is made of regular languages.

## How to prove a language is nonregular

- Pumping lemma argument
- Closure argument

## Why are some languages regular and others nonregular?

Consider the following two languages. Are they regular or nonregular?

$$
B =  \lbrace 1^k y \mid y \in \lbrace 0, 1\rbrace^* \text { and } y \text{ contains at least } k \text{ 1's, for } k \geq 1 \rbrace 
$$
$$
C =  \{1^k y \mid y \in \{0, 1\}^* \text{ and } y \text{ contains at most } k \text{ 1's, for } k \geq 1 \} 
$$

## Other closure operations

Given a language $A$, define its *reverse* $A^R$ to be the language consisting of all of the strings in $A$ taken backwards (e.g., $\{011, 100, 10\}^R = \{110, 001, 01\}$).

- Prove that the regular languages are closed under the reverse operation.

## More interesting symbols

Consider $\Sigma = \left\lbrace \frac{0}{0}, \frac{0}{1}, \frac{1}{0}, \frac{1}{1}  \right\rbrace$. A string in $\Sigma^\ast$ consists of a top binary string $t$ and a bottom binary string $b$ of equal lengths. Which of the following languages are regular?

$$
D =  \left\lbrace w = \frac{t}{b} \in \Sigma^\ast \mid t \text{ is the reverse of } b \right\rbrace 
$$
$$
E =  \left\lbrace w = \frac{t}{b} \in \Sigma^\ast \mid t > b \text{ as binary numbers} \right\rbrace 
$$
