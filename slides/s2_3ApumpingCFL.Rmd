# A Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

## Recall

- *Context-free languages* are those languages described by *context-free grammars*.
- These are the same as those languages recognized by *pushdown automata*.
- These include the regular languages as a proper subset.
    - The pumping lemma for regular languages shows this.

Today: Context-free languages suffer from a similar limitation.

## Pumping Lemma for CFL's

Let $A$ be a context-free language. Then there is a pumping length $p$ such that any string $s$ with $|s|\geq p$ can be divided as $s = uvxyz$ such that

1. For each $i\geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$,
2. $|vy| > 0$, and
3. $|vxy| \leq p$.

## Proof Outline

Suppose you are given a CFG that describes the language.

1. Choose the pumping length so that any parse tree has a "long enough" path.
2. Pigeonhole principle: on this long path, some variable must repeat.
3. Graft a subtree to make a bigger legal tree (pump).
4. Prune a subtree to make a smaller legal tree (pump down).

## Tree height vs string length

4. Consider the following grammar. The start state is $S$.
\begin{align*}
S & \rightarrow \varepsilon \mid \mathtt{0}S\mathtt{1} \mid SAS \mid \mathtt{111} \\
A & \rightarrow \mathtt{1}A{0} \mid \mathtt{0} \mid \mathtt{010} \mid ASA
\end{align*}
Recall that the *height* of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. What is the length of the largest string that a parse tree of height 5 can derive?
  
>- *Observe:* If $b$ is the length of the longest formula in a rule, then a string of length $h^b$ requires a tree of height at least $h$.  

## Pumping Lemma Proof

1. Choose the pumping length so that any parse tree has a "long enough" path: Take $p = b^{|V|+1}$, where $b$ is the length of the longest formula in any rule. (Choose a parse tree that has the fewest possible number of nodes.) Let $s \in A$ be given with $|s|\geq p$.
2. Pigeonhole principle: on this long path, some variable must repeat. Call the repeating variable $R$. (Consider two occurences of $R$ that occur in the bottom $|V|+1$ nodes of the longest path.)
3. Graft/pump (on board). 
4. Prune/pump down (on board). 

# Using the Pumping Lemma

## A language that is not context-free

Prove that the language $A = \{\mathtt{a}^n\mathtt{b}^n\mathtt{c}^n \mid n \geq 0\}$ is not context free.

## Another language that is not context free

Prove that the language $A = \{ww \mid w \in \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}^\ast \}$ is not context free.
