# An Unrecognizable Language

## Prework #1

1. Suppose that $A$ and its complement $\overline{A}$ are both recognizable. Prove that $A$ is decidable. 

## $\overline{A_\text{TM}}$ is unrecognizable

>- $A_\text{TM}$ is recognizable (last prework).
>- $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable (last time).
>    - Therefore, $A_\text{TM}$ and $\overline{A_\text{TM}}$ can't both be recognizable (today's prework).
>- So $\overline{A_\text{TM}}$ is unrecognizable.

## "Limitative Theorems"

All the limitative Theorems of ... the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you never represent yourself totally. [These theorems] all have the flavor of some ancient fairy tale which warns you that "To seek self-knowledge is to embark on a journey which will always be incomplete, cannot be charted on any map, will never halt, cannot be described." -- Douglas Hofstadter

# Limits of Computation, so far

## Machines and languages

- DFA's, NFA's, REX's recognize/describe *regular languages*.
- CFG's, PDA's describe/recognize *context-free languages*.
- TM's can compute anything algorithms can (Church-Turing thesis).
    + TM's recognize *recognizable languages*.
    + TM's decide *decidable languages*.
    
## Acceptance, Emptiness, and Equivalence Problems

For the following, $\mathcal{M}$ can be a DFA, NFA, PDA, CFG, REX, or TM.

- $A_\mathcal{M} = \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid M \text{ is an } \mathcal{M} \text{ and } M \text{ accepts } w \}$
- $E_\mathcal{M} = \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \text{ is an } \mathcal{M} \text{ and } L(M) = \emptyset\}$
- $\mathit{EQ}_\mathcal{M} = \{ \langle P, Q \rangle \mid P,Q \text{ are } \mathcal{M}\text{'s and } L(P) = L(Q) \}$

## Results So Far

We used properties of TM's to prove the following.

- $A_\text{DFA}$, $A_\text{NFA}$, $A_\text{REX}$, $A_\text{CFG}$, $A_\text{PDA}$ are all decidable.
- $E_\text{DFA}$, $E_\text{NFA}$, $E_\text{REX}$, $E_\text{CFG}$, $E_\text{PDA}$ are all decidable.
- $\mathit{EQ}_\text{DFA}$, $\mathit{EQ}_\text{NFA}$, $\mathit{EQ}_\text{REX}$ are decidable.
- $A_\text{TM}$ is **not** decidable!

We also observed that $\overline{A_\text{TM}}$ is not recognizable.

## Undecidability

An undecidable language represents a problem that can't be solved computationally.

- The proof that $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable used self-reference in an interesting (perhaps profound) way.
- This result is one of the fundamental "limitative" theorems of computer science.
- We will use the undecidability of $A_\text{TM}$ to prove that other problems are undecidable.

# Reduction Arguments

## "reduces to" Jargon

We say that *Problem $A$ reduces to Problem $B$* if a solution to $B$ gives us a way to solve $A$. For example,

- Finding the area of a circle *reduces to* finding its radius.
- Factoring a quadradic *reduces to* finding a rational root.
    + Factor $3x^2 + 30x - 1008$
    + If we know that $14$ is a root, factoring is easy.

## Reducibility and Languages

Remember that languages can be thought of as decision problems.

- Suppose $A$ and $B$ are languages.
- We say "$A$ reduces to $B$" if a TM decider for $B$ can be used to build a TM decider for $A$.
- If $A$ reduces to $B$ and $B$ is decidable, then $A$ is decidable.
- If $A$ reduces to $B$ and $A$ is undecidable, then $B$ is undecidable.

## $A_\text{TM}$ reduces to $\mathit{HALT}_\text{TM}$

Let $\mathit{HALT}_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M, w\rangle \mid M \text{ halts when run on } w\}$.

Given $\langle M, w\rangle$ a description of a TM $M$ and a string $w$, is there a TM decider $T$ that will accept if $M$ halts on $w$ and reject if it doesn't?

- Suppose $T$ were a TM decider for $\mathit{HALT}_\text{TM}$. 
- Then we could build a decider for $A_\text{TM}$: 
    + Given $\langle M, w\rangle$, run $T$ on $\langle M, w\rangle$.
    + If $T$ indicates that $M$ will not halt on $w$, reject.
    + Otherwise, run $M$ on $w$, and accept/reject accordingly.

Since $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable, $\mathit{HALT}_\text{TM}$ must be also.

## Example: $E_\text{TM}$ is undecidable

We show that $A_\text{TM}$ reduces to $E_\text{TM}$.

- Suppose $R$ is a decider for $E_\text{TM}$.
- Given a string $w$ and a TM $M$, we can build a machine $M_w$:
    + On input $x$, if $x\neq w$, reject.
    + If $x = w$, run $M$ on $w$ and accept if $M$ does.
- $L(M_w)$ will either be empty, or just $\{w\}$.
    + $M$ accepts $w$ iff $L(M_w) = \{w\}$

## Build a decider for $A_\text{TM}$

On input $\langle M, w \rangle$,

- Build $M_w$.
- Run $R$ (the decider for $E_\text{TM}$) on $M_w$.
- If $R$ accepts, reject. If $R$ rejects, accept.

Given a decider for $E_\text{TM}$, we have built a decider for $A_\text{TM}$. But we know $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable. Therefore there can be no such decider for $E_\text{TM}$.

## Example: $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM}$ is undecidable

Let $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \text{ is a TM and } L(M) \text{ is regular} \}$. We show that $A_\text{TM}$ reduces to $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM}$.

- Given a string $w$ and a TM $M$, we can build a machine $M_w$:
    + On input $x$, if $x = \mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n$ for some $n$, accept.
    + If $x \neq \mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n$, run $M$ on $w$ and accept if $M$ does.
- $L(M_w)$ will either be $\{\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n \mid n\geq 0\}$, or $\Sigma^\ast$.
    + $M$ accepts $w$ iff $L(M_w) = \Sigma^\ast$ (regular)
    + $M$ does not accept $w$ iff $L(M_w) = \{\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n \mid n\geq 0\}$ (nonregular)

## Build a decider for $A_\text{TM}$

On input $\langle M, w \rangle$,

- Build $M_w$.
- Run $S$ (a decider for $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM}$) on $M_w$.
- If $S$ accepts, accept. If $S$ rejects, reject.

Given a decider for $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM}$, we have built a decider for $A_\text{TM}$. But we know $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable. Therefore there can be no such decider for $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM}$.

## Example: $\mathit{EQ}_\text{TM}$ is undecidable

Suppose $T$ is a decider for $\mathit{EQ}_\text{TM}$. Let $M_\emptyset$ be a TM that rejects everything. Now we build a decider for $E_\text{TM}$:

On input $\langle M \rangle$,

- Run $T$ on $\langle M, M_\emptyset \rangle$.
- If $T$ accepts, accept. If $T$ rejects, reject.

So $E_\text{TM}$ reduces to $\mathit{EQ}_\text{TM}$. But we already know that $E_\text{TM}$ is undecidable. So $\mathit{EQ}_\text{TM}$ is undecidable also.
