## 2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] 

\begin{align*}
E & \rightarrow E + T \mid T \\
T & \rightarrow T \ast F \mid F \\
F & \rightarrow \mathtt{(} E \mathtt{)} \mid \mathtt{a}
\end{align*}

Give a derivation for the string $\mathtt{a}+\mathtt{a}+\mathtt{a}$, and illustrate your derivation with a tree (or some other way).

## 3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

\begin{align*}
E & \rightarrow E + T \mid T \\
T & \rightarrow T \ast F \mid F \\
F & \rightarrow \mathtt{(} E \mathtt{)} \mid \mathtt{a}
\end{align*}

Give a derivation for the string $((\mathtt{a}))$, and illustrate your derivation with a tree (or some other way).

## 4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Define a grammar that describes the set of all palindromes in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$, and give a derivation for $\mathtt{0110}$.

# Pushdown Automata

## Stacking in language

> The fact that Bill thinks that if someone needs glasses to read a magazine then that person shouldn't be allowed to drive makes me want to scream.
  
- The sentence starts with "The fact that..."
- We remember this phrase, but then parse the middle independently.
- When we are done with the middle, we go back and complete the thought.

## Stacks 

A **stack** is a data structure that stores symbols.

- You can *push* a symbol onto the top of the stack. 
    + This is how you write to the stack (store data).
- You can *pop* the top symbol off of the stack.
    + This is how you read from the stack.
    + You can only read the top symbol.
    + When you pop, it comes off of the stack, and the next symbol moves to the top.
- There is no bound on how big the stack can get.
- Analogy: Stack of plates in the DC.

## Pushdown Automata

A **pushdown automaton** (PDA) is a *nondeterministic* finite automaton that can write to and read from a stack at each transition. 

Arrow labels:
$$
\stackrel{a, b\rightarrow c}{\longrightarrow}
$$

- You follow this arrow if $a$ is the next input symbol and $b$ is the symbol on the top of the stack.
- In addition to changing states and consuming $a$, you replace $b$ with $c$ on the top of the stack.

## Nondeterminism

$$
\stackrel{a, b\rightarrow c}{\longrightarrow}
$$

- Any of $a,b,c$ can be $\varepsilon$.
    + If $a = \varepsilon$, you can make the transition without consuming a symbol from the input, as long as $b$ is on top of the stack.
    + If $b = \varepsilon$, it doesn't matter what is on top of the stack, but you have to push $c$.
    + If $c = \varepsilon$, you don't push anything, but you have to pop $b$ off the stack.
- You can also have multiple arrows for the same input symbol $a$, forming nondeterministic "threads".

## Example: $\{\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n \mid n\geq 0\}$

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/fig215.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


## Formal Definition of PDA

A **pushdown automaton** is a 6-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where $Q$, $\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, and $F$ are all finite sets, and

1. $Q$ is the set of states,
2. $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet,
3. $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet,
4. $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\} \times \Gamma \cup \{\varepsilon\} \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q\times \Gamma\cup\{\varepsilon\})$ is the transition function,
5. $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state, and 
6. $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states.

## Example

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/fig217.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Example: Building PDA's

Construct a PDA over $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$ that recognizes the set of strings of length at least 4 that start and end with the same two symbols.

- First give an informal description,
- Then draw the state diagram.
