# Running Times of Other Computational Models

## Time depends on the computational model

Last time, we observed different running times for the same problem on

- Single-tape TM's
- Multiple-tape TM's

Today, we'll quantify the difference this distinction makes, and also consider nondeterministic TM's.

## Multi-tape TM's

**Theorem 7.8.** Suppose $M$ is a $k$-tape TM with running time $t(n)$. Then $M$ can be converted to a single-tape TM with running time $O\left([t(n)]^2\right)$. 

. . .

Proof. For every step of $M$, our single-tape simulator $S$ has to

- Scan its whole tape to find the dotted symbols.
- Scan its whole tape again to update using $M$'s transitions.
- Potentally, shift the whole tape to emulate $M$ going off the right end of a tape. (Up to $k$ times).

So every transition of $M$ requires, potentially, $k+2$ scans of $S$'s tape.

## Multi-tape TM's, cont'd

So *one step of $M$* requires (at most) *$k+2$ scans of $S$'s tape.*

>- How long do $k+2$ scans of $S$'s tape take?
>    - How long is $S$'s tape? At most $t(n)$. (prework)
>    - $k+2$ scans take $(k+2)O(t(n))$ steps, which is $O(t(n))$, since $k$ is constant (with respect to $n$).
>- $M$ makes $t(n)$ transitions/steps. So $S$ makes $t(n)O(t(n)) = O\left([t(n)]^2\right)$ steps. $\Box$

## Polynomial equivalence

If one process can be converted to another at only a polynomial increase in time, the two processes are called **polynomially equivalent**.

- Emulating multi-tape TM by a single-tape TM requires squaring running time.
- *Multi-tape TM's are polynomially equivalent to single-tape TM's.*

In real life, that's a big deal. In complexity theory, however, it's not a big deal.

## Nondeterministic TM's

**Theorem 7.11.** Suppose $N$ is a *nondeterministic* TM with running time $t(n)$. Then $N$ can be emulated on a deterministic TM with running time $2^{O(t(n))}$.

. . .

 Proof. Our deterministic simulator $D$ works by doing a breadth-first search of $N$'s computation tree. 

>- Every path from the root to a leaf is at most $t(n)$ long.
>- WLOG tree is binary. If not, you can convert it to a binary tree in constant time. So the number of leaves is at most $2^{t(n)}$.
>- The number of nodes in the tree is less than $2\cdot 2^{t(n)} = O(2^{t(n)})$.
>- Every visit to a node costs $O(t(n))$. 
>- *Total time:* $O(t(n))O(2^{t(n)}) = 2^{O(t(n))}$. If you want $D$ to be a single-tape machine, you have to square that. But $\left(2^{O(t(n))}\right)^2 = 2^{O(t(n))}$. $\Box$


## Exponential costs

- Theorem 7.11 doesn't say going from a deterministic TM to a nondeterministic TM *must* come at an exponential cost.
- Theorem 7.11 says it can't be more than exponential cost.

However, exponential differences are *huge*. Polynomial equivalences are dwarfed in comparison.
