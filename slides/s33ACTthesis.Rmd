# Models of computation

## Machines and languages

- DFA's. 
    - Same as NFA's, GNFA's, regular expressions.
    - Recognize *regular languages*.
- PDA's 
    - Same as context-free grammars.
    - Recognize *context-free* languages.
- TM's
    - Same as multitape, nondeterministic TM's
    - Recognize *Turing-recognizable* languages.
    - Decide *decidable* languages.

# Algorithms

## "Definition" of an algorithm

> An *algorithm* is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output.  [Cormen, et. al.] 

## Describing algorithms (high level)

We describe algorithms in prose or *pseudocode*. We need to be able to do the following.

- Store and retrieve data (variables).
- Branch on a condition (if-then-else)
- Repeat steps until a condition changes (while- and for-loops).
- Add, subtract, multiply.
- Compare values for equality.
- ???

**Church-Turing Thesis:** Any task that be done by an algorithm can be done by a Turing Machine.

## Church-Turing Thesis

$$
\text{Intuitive notion of algorithms} = \text{Turing machine algorithms}
$$

- The TM model of computation is *robust*: Adding features to it does not change the set of languages it can recognize or decide.
    - Key features: RAM, finite number of states, finite amount of work done at each step.
- Any machine that can emulate a TM is as computationally powerful as any other machine (questions of efficiency aside).
- Any computational *limitations* of TM's are limitations of computers in general! ([even quantum computers](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1985.0070))

## Computable functions

- A function $f:\Sigma^\ast \longrightarrow \Sigma^\ast$ is called *computable* if some Turing machine $M$, on every input $w$, enters the accept state with just $f(w)$ on its tape.
- If strings can represent any type of input and output, then algorithms ("well-defined computational procedures that take some value as input and produce some value as output") are computable functions.

# Encoding Mathematical Objects

## Representing with strings

Any discrete/finite mathematical object can be represented as a string.

- Natural numbers, integers, rational numbers
- Polynomials, roots of polynomials
- Graphs (vertices and edges)
- DFA's, NFA's, PDA's, TM's
- etc.

TM's can accept any of these as input, given a suitable encoding.

## Example: Graphs

- An (undirected) graph is a list of vertices and edges (finite sets).
- Encoding: $\mathtt{(}\text{vertex list}\mathtt{)}\mathtt{(}\text{edge list}\mathtt{)}$
- Example: $\mathtt{(1,2,3,4)((1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(1,4))}$ 
    - Draw the graph.

## High-level TM description 

On input $\langle G \rangle$, the encoding of a graph $G$:

1. Mark the first vertex of $G$.
2. Repeat Step 3 until no new vertices are marked: 
3. For each vertex $v$ in $G$, mark if it shares an edge with a previously marked vertex.
4. Scan all vertices of $G$. If they are all marked, accept. Otherwise, reject.

What language is decided/recognized?

## Example: polynomials
