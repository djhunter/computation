# Prework Presentations

## 1. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] 

Prove that the language $A = \{\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{1}^n \mid n\geq 0\}$ is not context free.

## 2. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

Let $B$ be the language of strings in  $\{\mathtt{0},\mathtt{1}\}^\ast$ consisting of all palindromes that have the same number of $\mathtt{0}$'s as $\mathtt{1}$'s. Prove that $B$ is not context free.

## 4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Let $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c}, \mathtt{d}\}$, and let $C$ be the language of strings in $\Sigma^\ast$ having the same number of $\mathtt{a}$'s as $\mathtt{b}$'s and the same number of $\mathtt{c}$'s as $\mathtt{d}$'s. Prove that $C$ is not context free.

# Turing Machines

## Computational models so far

- *Regular languages* are described by regular expressions and recognized by DFA's and NFA's.
    + There are simple languages that are not regular.
- *Context-free languages* are described by context-free grammars and recognized by *pushdown automata*.
    + All regular languages are context free, including some nonregular languages.
    + There are simple languages that are not context free.

Today we'll introduce slightly more complicated model that is *much* more powerful.

## Turing machine: informally

- States and transitions
- Deterministic
- Instead of stack, uses a *tape*.
    + The tape has a beginning but no end (unbounded).
    + Initially, the input string is on the tape at the beginning.
    + At each transition, can read and/or write from/to the tape.
    + At each transition, can move the "tape head" left or right.
- Accepting and rejecting happen as soon as $q_\mathrm{accept}$ or $q_\mathrm{reject}$ is reached.

## Transition arrow notation

$$
\stackrel{a \rightarrow b, c}{\longrightarrow}
$$

- Follow this arrow if $a$ is the symbol on the tape at the location of the tape head ($a$ could be a list of symbols).
- Write $b$ to the tape (this could be blank, in which case you don't write anything).
- $c$ is the direction to move the tape head: L or R. 

## Simple Turing Machine example

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/simpletm.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Can omit reject state

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/simpletmnoreject.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Formal Definition

A *Turing Machine* is a 7-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_\mathrm{accept}, q_\mathrm{reject})$ where

1. $Q$ is a finite set of states,
2. $\Sigma$ is the alphabet (and does not contain $\sqcup$)
3. $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet ($\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$ and $\sqcup\in \Gamma$),
4. $\delta: Q\times \Gamma \longrightarrow Q\times \Gamma \times \{\mathrm{L,R}\}$ is the transition function,
5. $q_0, q_\mathrm{accept}, q_\mathrm{reject}$ are the start, accept, and reject states.

The tape starts with the input string, followed by an infinite sequence of blanks ($\sqcup$'s), and the tape head starts at the first symbol of the input string.

## TM for $A = \{\mathtt{0}^{2^n}\}$

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/tmM2.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Ways to describe a TM

- *Formal description of a TM:* State diagram
- *Implementation description of a TM:* Describe in words how the tape head moves and how it stores data. Specific states and transitions are not required.
- *High-level description of a TM:* Describe algorithm in words, without reference to implementation details (e.g., tape head management).

## TM for $A = \{\mathtt{0}^{2^n}\}$

**Implementation description:**

1. Move from left to right across the tape, $\mathtt{x}$-ing off every other $\mathtt{0}$.
2. If in 1 the tape contained only a single $\mathtt{0}$, accept.
3. Otherwise, if in 1 the number of $\mathtt{0}$'s is odd, reject.
4. Return the tape head to the left-hand end of the tape.
5. Go to stage 1.

## TM for $A = \{\mathtt{0}^{2^n}\}$

**High-level description:**

Repeatedly divide the number of zero's by two. If you get 1, you started with a power of 2. If you get an odd number greater than 1, you started with something that was not a power of 2.

## TM for $B = \{w\mathtt{\#}w \mid w \in \{0,1\}^\ast\}$

**Implementation description:**

1. Check to see if the first symbol matches the first symbol after the $\mathtt{\#}$ symbol by scanning the tape head across the tape. If not, reject. If they match $\mathtt{x}$-them both out.

2. Return the tape head to the first non-$\mathtt{x}$ symbol at the front of the tape. Repeat step 1 until only $\mathtt{x}$'s remain to the left of the $\mathtt{\#}$. If any symbols have not been $\mathtt{x}$'ed, reject. Otherwise, accept.

## TM for $B = \{w\mathtt{\#}w \mid w \in \{0,1\}^\ast\}$

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
