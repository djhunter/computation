# Prework Presentations

## 3. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] 

Apply the construction in the proof of Theorem 1.25 (page 45ff) to give a state diagram for a DFA with 6 states that recognizes $\{w \mid w \text{ ends in } \mathtt{01}\} \cup \{w \mid w \text{ has an odd number of symbols}\}$. Use your DFA's from questions 1 and 2.

## 4. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

Suppose that $A_1$ and $A_2$ are regular languages. Explain how to modify the proof of Theorem 1.25 to prove that (a) $A_1 \cap A_2$ is a regular language , and (b) $(A_1 \setminus A_2) \cup (A_2 \setminus A_1)$ is a regular language. (Note: $(A_1 \setminus A_2) \cup (A_2 \setminus A_1)$ is the set of all strings that are either in $A_1$ or in $A_2$, but not both.)

## 5. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Give a state diagram for an NFA that recognizes $A$, where
$$A = \{ xy \mid x \text{ has an even number of 0's and } \\ y \text{ has an odd number of 1's} \}. $$

# Regular Languages and Regular Operations

## Languages and Operations so far

- A language is called **regular** if some finite automaton recogizes it.
- Regular operations are union $\cup$, concatenation $\circ$, and star $*$.
- We proved that the union of two regular languages is regular.
    + We did this by proving that we could make an automaton $M$ that recognizes $A_1 \cup A_2$, given automata $M_1$ and $M_2$ that recognize $A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively.
    + Dealing with $\circ$ and $*$ is more tricky.

# Nondeterminism

## DFA vs NFA

- DFA: **Deterministic** Finite Automaton (what we have been doing)
- NFA: **Non-Deterministic** Finite Automaton (new)

In an NFA, we can have multiple arrows for the same symbol, or no arrows for some symbols, or an arrow lableled with $\varepsilon$.


- Each arrow spawns a new machine in the new state.
- $\varepsilon$ spawns a new machine in the new state without consuming an input character.
- Similar to Multithreading
- If any machine ends in an accept state, the NFA accepts.

## Example NFA

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3.5, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(igraph)
a4 <- graph_from_literal(" "-+q1-+q2-+q3-+q4-+q4, q1-+q1, simplify=FALSE)
coords <- layout_on_grid(a4, width = 5)
plot(a4, 
     edge.curved = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.5), 
     layout=coords,
     vertex.size = 15,
     vertex.shape = c("none", "circle", "circle", "circle", "circle"),
     vertex.label = c(" ", expression(italic(q)[1]), expression(italic(q)[2]), expression(italic(q)[3]), expression(italic(q)[4])),
     edge.loop.angle=3.14*1.5,
     mark.groups = list(5), mark.shape = 0.75, mark.col = "pink", mark.border = "black",
     vertex.label.cex = 1,
     edge.label = c("","     1\n", expression(atop("   0," ~ epsilon,  " ")), "  1\n","0,1\n","0,1\n"), 
     edge.label.cex = 1,
     edge.width = 2,
     ylim = c(-1.02,-0.65), xlim=c(-0.1,0.5))
```

## NFA "guessing"

$A = \{w \mid w \text{ has a 1 in the third position from end}\}$

How do you know when you are at the third position from the end?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.2, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(igraph)
a4 <- graph_from_literal(" "-+q1-+q2-+q3-+q4, q1-+q1, simplify=FALSE)
coords <- layout_on_grid(a4, width = 5)
plot(a4, 
     edge.curved = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5), 
     layout=coords,
     vertex.size = 15,
     vertex.shape = c("none", "circle", "circle", "circle", "circle"),
     vertex.label = c(" ", expression(italic(q)[1]), expression(italic(q)[2]), expression(italic(q)[3]), expression(italic(q)[4])),
     edge.loop.angle=3.14*1.5,
     mark.groups = list(5), mark.shape = 0.75, mark.col = "pink", mark.border = "black",
     vertex.label.cex = 1,
     edge.label = c("","     1\n", "   0,1\n", "   0,1\n", "0,1\n"), 
     edge.label.cex = 1,
     edge.width = 2,
     ylim = c(-1.05,-0.65), xlim=c(0,0.5))
```

## DFA version

$A = \{w \mid w \text{ has a 1 in the third position from end}\}$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)

```

```

# Closure under concatenation and star (and union)

## Closure constructions

If we have NFA's $N_1$ and $N_2$ that recognize languages $A_1$ and $A_2$, can we construct

- an NFA that recognizes $A_1 \circ A_2$?
- an NFA that recognizes $A_1^*$?

## Closure under concatenation

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/nfaconcat.png")
```

## Closure under star

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/nfastar.png")
```


## Closure under union (using NFA's)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/nfaunion.png")
```


# What languages do NFA's recognize?

## Closure constructions

We have proved that if we have NFA's $N_1$ and $N_2$ that recognize languages $A_1$ and $A_2$, can we construct

- an NFA that recognizes $A_1 \circ A_2$
- an NFA that recognizes $A_1^*$
- an NFA that recognizes $A_1 \cup A_2$.

So the set of languages that can be recognized by an NFA is closed under the regular operations.

## A DFA is an NFA

## Is an NFA a DFA?

## Formal Definition of a DFA

A **finite automaton** (DFA) is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where

1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**,
3. $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \longrightarrow Q$ is the **transition function**,
4. $q_0 \in Q$ is the **start state**, and
5. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accept states**.

What modifications would we need to make to define an NFA?
