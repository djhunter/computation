# Pumping Lemma Proof Techniques

## Pumping Lemma {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

*Theorem 1.70 (Pumping Lemma).* If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$ (the "pumping length") such that, if $s\in A$ has length at least $p$, then $s = xyz$, where:

1. for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A$,
2. $|y| > 0$, and
3. $|xy| \leq p$.


##  Pumping Down {data-transition="fade"}

*Theorem 1.70 (Pumping Lemma).* If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$ (the "pumping length") such that, if $s\in A$ has length at least $p$, then $s = xyz$, where:

1. for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A$,
2. $|y| > 0$, and
3. $|xy| \leq p$.

**Pumping down** is when we reach a contradiction using $i=0$ in step 1.

Example: Use the Pumping Lemma to prove that $A=\{0^i1^j \mid i > j \}$ is not a regular language.

## Using Closure {data-transition="fade-in slide-out"}

*Theorem 1.70 (Pumping Lemma).* If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$ (the "pumping length") such that, if $s\in A$ has length at least $p$, then $s = xyz$, where:

1. for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A$,
2. $|y| > 0$, and
3. $|xy| \leq p$.

Regular languages are **closed** under $\cap, \cup, \circ, \overline{\phantom{X}}, *$, XOR.

Example: Prove that the language $A = \{w \mid w \text{ has the same number of 1's as 0's}\}$ is nonregular.

## Unary languages and numbers {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

A **unary** language is a language over an alphabet with one symbol, e.g., $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}\}$.

- Strings in the language have the form $\mathtt{0}^k$, for $k\geq 0$.
- Strings correspond to numbers ($\mathtt{0}^k \leftrightarrow k$).
- Languages correspond to sets of numbers.
- Regular expressions correspond to DFA's that can tell if a number belongs to a particular set!

    + $\{\mathtt{0}^{2k} \mid k\geq 0\}$ (the even numbers) is regular. (why?)
    + $\{\mathtt{0}^{k^2} \mid k\geq 0\}$ (the perfect squares) is nonregular. (next slide)

## A nonregular Unary language 

*Theorem 1.70 (Pumping Lemma).* If $A$ is a regular language, then there is a number $p$ (the "pumping length") such that, if $s\in A$ has length at least $p$, then $s = xyz$, where:

1. for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A$,
2. $|y| > 0$, and
3. $|xy| \leq p$.

Example: Use the Pumping Lemma to prove that $A=\{\mathtt{0}^{n^2} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is not a regular language.
