# Last time

## Recall: Countable sets

- A set is *countable* if there is an injection $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{N}$.
- Informally, "countable" means you can number the elements $s_1,s_2,s_3,\ldots$ in such a way that for any $x \in X$, there exists an $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $s_n = x$. (It is ok to have $s_i = s_j$ for some $i\neq j$.)

## $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable

Cantor's diagonalization argument 

# Countability and Languages

## Classes of languages

- Regular 
- Context free 
- Decidable 
- Recognizable 

$$
\text{Regular} \subsetneq \text{Context Free} \subsetneq \text{Decidable} \stackrel{?}{\subsetneq} \text{Recognizable}
$$

We have yet to find any examples of languages that are nonrecognizable, or even undecidable. Are all languages decidable? recognizable?

## Formal Description of TM

A *Turing Machine* is a 7-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_\mathrm{accept}, q_\mathrm{reject})$ where

1. $Q$ is a finite set of states,
2. $\Sigma$ is the alphabet (and does not contain $\sqcup$)
3. $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet ($\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$ and $\sqcup\in \Gamma$),
4. $\delta: Q\times \Gamma \longrightarrow Q\times \Gamma \times \{\mathrm{L,R}\}$ is the transition function,
5. $q_0, q_\mathrm{accept}, q_\mathrm{reject}$ are the start, accept, and reject states.

*Q.* How many TM's are there?

. . .

*A.* There are countably many Turing Machines. (They are representable as finite binary strings, and the set to all finite binary strings is $\{\mathtt{0},\mathtt{1}\}^\ast$, which is countable.)

## Languages

- A *language* is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.
- Recall that $\Sigma^*$ is countable.
- WLOG can take $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$.

*Q.* How many languages are there?

. . .

*A.* There are uncountably many languages (diagonalization argument).

## TM's and Languages

Observation. Every TM recognizes exactly one language.

## Some languages are not recognizable

Proof:

- There are countably many Turing machines.
- There are uncountably many languages.
- Every TM recognizes exactly one language.

Therefore, some language must not be recognizable by any TM!
