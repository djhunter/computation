# Languages as Problems

## Emptiness problems

These languages are decidable. 

- $E_\text{DFA} = \{\langle A\rangle \mid A \text{ is a DFA and } L(A) = \emptyset\}$
- $E_\text{CFG} = \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \text{ is a CFG and } L(G) = \emptyset \}$

In other words, the *emptiness problems* for DFA's and CFG's are decidable. A TM can tell if a DFA or CFG has an empty language.

## Equivalence problems

- $EQ_\text{DFA} = \{\langle A, B\rangle \mid A,B \text{ are DFA's and } L(A) = L(B)\}$ is decidable.

In other words, the *equivalence problem* for DFA's is decidable. A TM can tell if two DFA's generate the same language.

## Acceptance problems

These languages are decidable. 

- $A_\text{DFA} = \{\langle B,w \rangle \mid B\text{ is a DFA accepting } w \}$
- $A_\text{CFG} =  \{\langle G, w\rangle \mid G \text{ is a CFG generating } w\}$

In other words, the *acceptance problems* for DFA's and CFG's are decidable. A TM can tell if a given DFA or CFG recognizes a given string.

# An undecidable language

## $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable

- $A_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M, w\rangle \mid M \text{ is a TM that accepts } w\}$ is recognizable (prework).
- Theorem: $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable.
    - i.e., the acceptance problem for TM's is undecidable.
    
Proof (by contradiction) on board.

## Summary of proof

Suppose to the contrary that a TM $H$ decides $A_\text{TM}$.

- $H$ accepts $\langle M, w\rangle$ exactly when $M$ accepts $w$.
- $D$ rejects $\langle M \rangle$ exactly when $M$ accepts $\langle M \rangle$.
- $D$ rejects $\langle D \rangle$ exactly when $D$ accepts $\langle D \rangle$, a contradiction.

## Proof as a diagonalization argument

(on board)

# The halting problem

## The Halting Problem

Given $\langle M, w\rangle$ a description of a TM $M$ and a string $w$, is there a TM decider $T$ that will accept if $M$ halts on $w$ and reject if it doesn't?

Suppose there were. Then we could decide the acceptance problem:

- Given $\langle M, w\rangle$, run $T$ on $\langle M, w\rangle$.
- If $T$ indicates that $M$ will not halt on $w$, reject.
- Otherwise, run $M$ on $w$, and accept/reject accordingly.

Since the acceptance problem is undecidable, the halting problem must be also.
