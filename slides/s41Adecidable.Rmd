# Emulation on TM's

## {data-background="https://www.dreamarcades.com/images/fullsized/cabaret.jpg" data-background-size="contain"}

## Recall: DFA definition

Recall the formal definition of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) as a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where

1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**,
3. $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \longrightarrow Q$ is the **transition function**,
4. $q_0 \in Q$ is the **start state**, and
5. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accept states**.

All of these objects can be *encoded* as strings.

## A TM that will run any DFA

We want to build a TM that has:

- Input: A description of a DFA $B$ and a string $w$, encoded as a string $\langle B, w\rangle$.
- Output: Accept if $B$ accepts $w$. Reject if $B$ rejects $w$.

Alphabets? Tapes?

## Some implementation details

- Use binary digits for $B$'s alphabet.
- Separate tapes for parts of $B$:
    - $Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F$
- Encode $w$ in binary.

(on board)

## High-level description

1. Find current state in $Q$ and next input symbol in $w$.
2. Go through $\delta$ and find state and symbol.
3. Update $Q$.
4. Repeat 1-3 until no more input symbols remain.
5. If final state is in $F$, accept. Otherwise, reject.

Recognizer? Decider?

## The language $A_\text{DFA}$

The language decided by our "DFA emulator" is

$$
A_\text{DFA} = \{\langle B,w \rangle \mid B\text{ is a DFA accepting } w \}
$$

Our construction proves:

**Theorem.** $A_\text{DFA}$ is decidable.

## Corollaries

- **Theorem.** $A_\text{DFA}$ is decidable.
- **Corollary.** $A_\text{NFA} = \{\langle B,w \rangle \mid B\text{ is a NFA accepting } w \}$ is decidable.
- **Corollary.** $A_\text{REX} = \{\langle R,w \rangle \mid R\text{ is a regular expression generating } w \}$ is decidable.

## How about $A_\text{PDA}$?

- We could build a TM that emulates any PDA on any input.
- However, would it be a decider? Or just a recognizer?

(It turns out that $A_\text{PDA} = \{\langle B,w \rangle \mid B\text{ is a PDA accepting } w \}$ is decidable, but we have to use grammars to prove it (next time).)

# Equivalence of DFA's

## Can we tell if two DFA's are the same?

Given descriptions of two DFA's, can we tell if they recognize the same language?

In other words, is the following language decidable?
$$
EQ_\text{DFA} = \{\langle A, B\rangle \mid A,B \text{ are DFA's and } L(A) = L(B)\}
$$

## Related Question: Emptiness

Can we test whether a DFA recognizes nothing? That is, is 

$$
E_\text{DFA} = \{\langle A\rangle \mid A \text{ is a DFA and } L(A) = \emptyset\}
$$
decidable?

(Proof/nonproof on board.)

## $EQ_\text{DFA}$ is decidable

- Regular languages are closed under XOR. (old exercise)
- Given two DFA's $A$, $B$, build a DFA $C$ recognizing their XOR.
- Note that $L(C) = \emptyset$ iff $L(A) = L(B)$.
- Use the emptiness testing machine on $C$.
