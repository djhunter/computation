## "Limitative Theorems"

All the limitative Theorems of ... the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you never represent yourself totally. [These theorems] all have the flavor of some ancient fairy tale which warns you that "To seek self-knowledge is to embark on a journey which will always be incomplete, cannot be charted on any map, will never halt, cannot be described." -- Douglas Hofstadter
