## 2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] 

Sometimes pushdown automata have states that are never entered on any input. Construct a TM decider that will input a PDA description $\langle P \rangle$ and accept if $P$ has such a state and reject if $P$ doesn't have such a state. (Hint: We know that $E_\text{CFG}$ is decidable, so there is a TM decider $M_\emptyset$ that decides $E_\text{PDA} = \{\langle P \rangle \mid P \text{ is a PDA and } L(P) = \emptyset\}$. Use $M_\emptyset$ in your construction.)

## 3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

We say that a language is *closed under reversal* if, for every $w$ in the language, its reverse $w^R$ is also in the language. Construct a TM decider that inputs a DFA description $\langle D \rangle$ and accepts iff $L(D)$ is closed under reversal. (Hint: We have a decider for $EQ_\text{DFA}$.)

## 4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Let $Q = \{\langle D \rangle \mid D \text{ is a DFA and } L(D) \text{ contains a string with } \mathtt{01110} \text{ as a substring}\}$. Show that $Q$ is decidable by building a TM decider for it. (Hint: We have a decider for $E_\text{DFA}$.)

# An Unrecognizable Language

## Prework #1

1. Suppose that $A$ and its complement $\overline{A}$ are both recognizable. Prove that $A$ is decidable. 

## $\overline{A_\text{TM}}$ is unrecognizable

## "Limitative Theorems"

All the limitative Theorems of ... the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss fo death: it guarantees that you never represent yourself totally. [These theorems] all have the flavor of some ancient fairy tale which warns you that "To seek self-knowledge is to embark on a journey which will always be incomplete, cannot be charted on any map, will never halt, cannot be described." -- Douglas Hofstadter
