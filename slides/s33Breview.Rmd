## 2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] 

Give an implementation description of a TM (possibly multitape or nondeterministic) that decides the language of all strings of the form $\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{\#}q$, where $q$ is an encoding of the quadratic polynomial $Ax^2 + Bx + C$ (as defined in Problem 1), and $n$ is a root of this polynomial (i.e., $An^2 + Bn + C = 0$).

## 3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

Determine the language recognized by the following two-stack PDA.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=3}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("../prework/images/twostackpda.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## 5. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Explain how to simulate a TM with a two-stack PDA. (For each type of transition of the TM (left or right), explain how the two stacks are managed in a way that is equivalent to writing on the TM's tape.)

## Practice Problems (groups)

Consider the language $A = \{\mathtt{0}^n \mid n \text{ is prime}\}$.

1. Prove that $A$ is not context free.
2. Give an implementation description of a TM that decides $A$.
