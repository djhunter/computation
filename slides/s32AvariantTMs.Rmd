# Prework Presentations

## 1. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`]  

Read pages 176--177 (or pages 148--149 in the Second Edition). Explain (in your own words) how you can simulate a Multitape Turing Machine on a regular single-tape TM.

## 2. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

Let $A = \{\mathtt{a}^i\mathtt{b}^j\mathtt{c}^k\mathtt{d}^l \mid ij = kl,\, i,j,k,l\geq 1\}$. Give an implementation description of a decider for $A$.

## 3. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Let $B = \{b_1\mathtt{\#}b_2 \mid b_1,b_2\in\{\mathtt{0},\mathtt{1}\}^\ast \text{ and } b_1 > b_2 \text{ as binary numbers}\}$. Give an implementation description of a decider for $B$.

# Recall: Deciders vs. Recognizers

## Decider {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/simpletmnoreject.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Recognizer, not Decider {data-transition="fade-in slide-out"}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/simpletmloop.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Recognizing and Deciding

- A TM **recognizes** a language $A$ if the set of strings that it accepts is the set $A$. (*Recognizers* might have infinite loops.)
- A TM **decides** $A$ if it accepts every string that is in $A$ and rejects every string that is not in $A$. (*Deciders* always *halt*.)

If a language has a decider, it is called **decidable**.

# Enumerators

## Can we list the elements of $\Sigma^\ast$?

>- Given a set $S$, is there a way to write all the elements of $S$ in a (possibly infinite) listing $s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$?
>- More formally, is there a one-to-one map $S \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$?
>- If such a map exists, $S$ is called *countable*.
>    - $\Sigma^*$ is countable, for any finite alphabet $\Sigma$.
>    - Every language over $\Sigma$ is countable.

## Enumerator

- An **enumerator** is a TM with an attached "printer".
- Instead of accepting strings, it prints them out.
- Can run without halting.

A string $w$ belongs to *the language enumerated* by an enumerator $E$ if $E$ eventually prints $w$.

## Enumerator $\leftrightarrow$ Recognizer

- Given an enumerator for a language, we can build a TM recognizer for it.
    - Obvious?
- Given a recognizer for a language, we can build an enumerator for it.
    - Subtle?

# Nondeterminism

## Nondeterministic Turing Machines

- A **Nondeterministic Turing Machine** allows multiple threads for the same input symbol:
$$
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q\times \Gamma \times \{\mathrm{L}, \mathrm{R}\})
$$
- Can be simulated on a TM, but there's a subtlety.
    - Can't run threads in series. (why?)
    - Run each thread to the same depth, for depths $1,2,3,\ldots$ 
    - Use three tapes:
        - One for input (leave unchanged)
        - One to simulate the tape for the current thread 
        - One to keep track of which thread to run and how deep to run it
