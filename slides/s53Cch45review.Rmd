# Main Results of Chapters 4

## Languages as problems

- If $L(M) = A$ for some TM decider $M$, then $A$ is decidable.
- If $L(M) = A$ for some TM recognizer $M$, then $A$ is recognizable.

We state certain decision problems as languages, where a valid string in the language is an instance of the decision problem that results in *accept*. (e.g., $\langle M, w\rangle$)

## Emptiness problems

These languages are decidable. 

- $E_\text{DFA} = \{\langle A\rangle \mid A \text{ is a DFA and } L(A) = \emptyset\}$
- $E_\text{CFG} = \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \text{ is a CFG and } L(G) = \emptyset \}$

In other words, the *emptiness problems* for DFA's and CFG's are decidable. A TM can tell if a DFA or CFG has an empty language.

## Equivalence problems

- $EQ_\text{DFA} = \{\langle A, B\rangle \mid A,B \text{ are DFA's and } L(A) = L(B)\}$ is decidable.

In other words, the *equivalence problem* for DFA's is decidable. A TM can tell if two DFA's generate the same language.

## Acceptance problems

These languages are decidable. 

- $A_\text{DFA} = \{\langle B,w \rangle \mid B\text{ is a DFA accepting } w \}$
- $A_\text{CFG} =  \{\langle G, w\rangle \mid G \text{ is a CFG generating } w\}$

In other words, the *acceptance problems* for DFA's and CFG's are decidable. A TM can tell if a given DFA or CFG recognizes a given string.

# An undecidable language

## $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable

- Observation: $A_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M, w\rangle \mid M \text{ is a TM that accepts } w\}$ is recognizable.
    - There are countably many TM's, but uncountably many languages (diagonalization argument), so some languages are not recognizable.
- Theorem: $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable.
    - Diagonalization proof.
- Corollary: $\overline{A_\text{TM}}$ is not recognizable.

# Chapter 5 Main Results

## Reduction arguments

We say "$A$ reduces to $B$" if a TM decider for $B$ can be used to build a TM decider for $A$.

- If $A$ reduces to $B$ and $B$ is decidable, then $A$ is decidable.
- If $A$ reduces to $B$ and $A$ is undecidable, then $B$ is undecidable.

We proved that several languages/problems were undecidable, by reducing from $A_\text{TM}$. (Notable examples: $\mathit{EQ}_\text{CFG}$, $PCP$)

## Mapping reductions

Let $A$ and $B$ be languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$. We say that $A$ is *mapping reducible* to $B$, written $A \leq_\text{m} B$, if there is a computable function (i.e., a *reduction*) $f:\Sigma^\ast \longrightarrow \Sigma^\ast$ such that, for every $w \in \Sigma^\ast$, 
$$
w \in A \Longleftrightarrow f(w) \in B
$$

-  **Theorem 5.22.** Suppose $A \leq_\text{m} B$. If $B$ is decidable, then $A$ is decidable. If $A$ is undecidable, then $B$ is undecidable.
-  **Theorem 5.28.** Suppose $A \leq_\text{m} B$. If $B$ is recognizable, then $A$ is recognizable. If $A$ is not recognizable, then $B$ is not recognizable.
