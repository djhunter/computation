# Prework Presentations

## 2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] 

Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the set of all palindromes in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$.

## 3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] 

Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the set of all strings in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$ that have the same number of $\mathtt{0}$'s as $\mathtt{1}$'s.

## 4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] 

Let $A = \{\mathtt{a}^i\mathtt{b}^j\mathtt{c}^k \mid i = j \text{ or } j=k \text{ where } i,j,k\geq 0\}$. Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the language $A$.

## Look at Prework #1

# Building a PDA for a CFG

## Context-free languages so far

- A *context-free language* is a language described by a *context-free grammar (CFG)*.
- CFG's can describe languages that regular expressions cannot.
- *Pushdown automata (PDA's)* can recognize everything that NFA/DFA's can, and more.

Today we'll show how to construct a PDA to recognize any given CFG's language.

## Programming a PDA for a CFG

**Lemma 2.21** Given a CFG that describes a language $A$, there is a PDA that recognizes $A$.

Proof: Construct a PDA that:

1. Pushes the start variable $S$ to the stack, then
2. Nondeterministically replaces any variables on the stack according to CFG rules, while it
3. Matches terminals on stack with terminals on input string. 

## Top-level structure

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/toplevelpda.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Example: Prework #1

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("/home/dhunter/Dropbox/macs135/R135/prework/images/pda3ipe.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

## Example: On board

Use the procedure in the proof of Lemma 2.21 to build a PDA that recognizes the language described by the following CFG.

\begin{align*}
S & \rightarrow \mathtt{a}T\mathtt{b} \mid \mathtt{b} \\
T & \rightarrow T\mathtt{a} \mid \varepsilon
\end{align*}

## Why does it always work?

- Nondeterminism takes into account any possible substitution at any point.
- Input string only gets processed as long as it matches the stack.
- Any discrepancy will terminate the nondeterministic thread.

# Equivalence of CFG's and PDA's

## Converse is also true

**Lemma 2.27.** Given any PDA, it is possible to construct a CFG that describes the language it recognizes.

*Proof:* Omit. (Read book if you are curious.)

## Punchline

The context-free languages are precisely those recognized by PDA's, and these languages include the regular languages as a proper subset.
