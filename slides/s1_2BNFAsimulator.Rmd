# Regular Languages, Operations, DFA's, NFA's

## So far...

- A language is called **regular** if some DFA recogizes it.
- The set of all languages recognized by NFA's is closed under $\cup$, $\circ$, and $*$, the **regular operations**.
- A DFA is obviously an NFA.

Today we'll show that an NFA can be *simulated* on a DFA. This will finish the proof that **the regular languages are closed under the regular operations**.

# Simulating an NFA on a DFA

## Formal Definition of a DFA

A **deterministic finite automaton** (DFA) is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where

1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**,
3. $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \longrightarrow Q$ is the **transition function**,
4. $q_0 \in Q$ is the **start state**, and
5. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accept states**.

An NFA has different arrow rules, i.e., a different transition function.

## Formal Definition of an NFA

A **nondeterministic finite automaton** (NFA) is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where

1. $Q$ is a finite set called the **states**,
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabet**,
3. $\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\}) \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is the **transition function**,
4. $q_0 \in Q$ is the **start state**, and
5. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of **accept states**.

Difference: The transition function outputs a *subset* of states, not just a single state, as in a DFA, and we allow $\varepsilon$ as a label.

## NFA Simulator

- Main idea: The states of our DFA will be the **power set** of the states of the NFA that it simulates.
- Each subset of NFA states (i.e., each state of the DFA) represents the states of the active threads in the NFA.
- The transition function, start, and accept states will be natural.

## Example: NFA to simulate

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/nfa3.png")
```

We are going to construct a DFA that recognizes the same language.

## DFA States

If $Q$ are the states of the given NFA, $\mathcal{P}(Q)$ are the states of the DFA.

## DFA Transition Function (Arrows), sort of

Let $X \subseteq Q$ be a state of the DFA. Then $\delta_\text{DFA}(X,\sigma) = \displaystyle{\bigcup_{x \in X} \delta_\text{NFA}(x,\sigma)}$. 

- That is, it is the subset of $Q$ containing all the possible next states for our NFA, starting at all the states of our subset $X$.

- (We'll deal with the $\varepsilon$ arrows next.)

</div>

## What about the $\varepsilon$ arrows?

Actually, we need to define $\delta_\text{DFA}$ a little differently.

- If $X \subset Q$, let $E(X)$ be the set of states reachable from states in $X$ by following 0 or more $\varepsilon$ arrows.
- Redefine  $\delta_\text{DFA}(X, \sigma) = \displaystyle{\bigcup_{x \in X} E(\delta_\text{NFA}(x, \sigma))}$. 
- i.e., treat $\varepsilon$ arrows as "cooties" (?) If an NFA arrow points to a state with outgoing $\varepsilon$ arrows, you have to follow them too.

## Start State

- If $q_0$ is the start state of the NFA, $E(\{q_0\})$ is the start state of the DFA.
- i.e., the set of the NFA start state, along with any states that it gives cooties to (?).

## Accepting States

- Any subset of $Q$ that contains an accept state of the NFA is an accept state of the DFA.

$$
F_\text{DFA} = \{ X \in \mathcal{P}(Q) \mid X \cap F_\text{NFA} \neq \emptyset \}
$$

## Why does it work?

- The simulator keeps track of active states using the subsets.
- Multiple arrows and $\varepsilon$ arrows are dealt with properly.
- Any one accepting state on any thread in the NFA will be reached in the DFA.
- If the NFA reaches no active accepting state by the end of the input, the DFA will be in a non-accepting state.

## Simplification is often possible

Unreachable states in the DFA can be deleted.
