## Prework 3.1b: More Turing Machines

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:4], sep = ',')`] Read pages 176--177 (or pages 148--149 in the Second Edition). Explain (in your own words) how you can simulate a Multitape Turing Machine on a regular single-tape TM.

2. [`r paste(fnames[5:8], sep = ',')`]  Let $A = \{\mathtt{a}^i\mathtt{b}^j\mathtt{c}^k\mathtt{d}^l \mid ij = kl,\, i,j,k,l\geq 1\}$. Give an implementation description of a decider for $A$.

3. [`r paste(fnames[9:13], sep = ',')`]  Let $B = \{b_1\mathtt{\#}b_2 \mid b_1,b_2\in\{\mathtt{0},\mathtt{1}\}^\ast \text{ and } b_1 > b_2 \text{ as binary numbers}\}$. Give an implementation description of a decider for $B$.
