## Prework 1.4a: The Pumping Lemma

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:4], sep = ',')`] Read Example 1.75 on page 81. The last line of the third paragraph states, "With condition 3 the proof follows because $y$ must consist of only \texttt{0}s, so $xyyz\not\in F$." Explain, in more detail than is given in the book, why $xyyz\not\in F$.

2. [`r paste(fnames[5:8], sep = ',')`] In the last sentence of Example 1.75, it says that the string $\mathtt{0}^p\mathtt{0}^p$ "can be pumped." Explain, what this means, and, specifically, how it can be pumped.

3. [`r paste(fnames[9:13], sep = ',')`] Use the Pumping Lemma to show that the language $A = \{www \mid w \in \{\mathtt{a},\mathtt{b}\}^*\}$ is not regular.
