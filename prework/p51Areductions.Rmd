## Prework 5.1a: Reduction Arguments

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:4], sep = ',')`] Let $\mathit{CFL}_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \text{ is a TM and } L(M) \text{ is context free}\}$. Show that $\mathit{CFL}_\text{TM}$ is undecidable by showing that $A_\text{TM}$ reduces to $\mathit{CFL}_\text{TM}$. (Hint: Mimic the reduction argument for $\mathit{REGULAR}_\text{TM}$.)

2. [`r paste(fnames[5:9], sep = ',')`] During the course of a computation, we say that a TM *erases* if it ever writes a blank symbol on its tape. Let $\mathit{ERASE}_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid M \text{ erases when run on input } w \}$. Show that $\mathit{ERASE}_\text{TM}$ is undecidable by showing that $A_\text{TM}$ reduces to $\mathit{ERASE}_\text{TM}$. (Hint: Look at Problem 5.10 and its solution in the text.)

3. [`r paste(fnames[10:13], sep = ',')`] Recall that in our definition of a TM, we specified that the tape head does not move if, during the course of a computation, it is instructed to move left when it is already at the beginning of the tape. Call such an event a *thud*. Let $\mathit{THUD}_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid M \text{ thuds when run on input } w\}$. Show that $\mathit{THUD}_\text{TM}$ is undecidable by showing that $A_\text{TM}$ reduces to $\mathit{THUD}_\text{TM}$.
