## Prework 7.4a: Vertex Covers

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:2], sep = ',')`] A *vertex cover* of an undirected graph $G$ is a subset of vertices of $G$ such that every edge in $G$ touches some vertex in the cover. What is the smallest vertex cover of the Petersen graph?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="2cm"}
library(knitr) # add out.width="4cm" for pdf output
include_graphics("../slides/images/petersen.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

2. [`r paste(fnames[3:4], sep = ',')`] The *complement* $\overline{G}$ of a graph $G$ is the graph with the same vertex set, but with edges between pairs of vertices that do *not* have edges in $G$. How many edges are in the complement of the Petersen graph?

3. [`r paste(fnames[5:7], sep = ',')`] Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices. Prove that if $G$ has a clique with $k$ vertices, then $\overline{G}$ has a vertex cover with $n-k$ vertices. (Hint: First, try some examples with small values of $n$, e.g., $n=5$.)

4. [`r paste(fnames[8:10], sep = ',')`]  Prove the converse of the statement in #3: If $\overline{G}$ has a vertex cover of size $n-k$, then $G$ has a clique of size $k$.

5. [`r paste(fnames[11:13], sep = ',')`] Let $\mathit{VERTEX\text{-}COVER} = \{\langle G, k\rangle \mid G \text{ has a vertex cover of size } k\}$. Recall that $\mathit{CLIQUE} = \{\langle G, k \rangle \mid G \text{ has a clique with } k \text{ vertices} \}$. Prove that $\mathit{CLIQUE} \leq_\text{P} \mathit{VERTEX\text{-}COVER}$ by describing a polynomial-time reduction function, and also explain why $\mathit{VERTEX\text{-}COVER}$ is $\text{NP}$-complete.
