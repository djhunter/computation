## Prework 7.3a: Languages in $\text{NP}$

1. A formula in Boolean (i.e., propositional) logic is *satisfiable* if there are 1/0 values (i.e., T/F values) that can be assigned to the variables to make the statement true. See pp. 14--15 if you need to refresh your memory. Determine whether the following formula is satisfiable.
$$
(x \vee y) \wedge (x\vee \bar{y}) \wedge (\bar{x} \vee y) \wedge (\bar{x} \vee \bar{y})
$$

2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] Let $\mathit{SAT} = \{ \langle \phi \rangle \mid \phi \text{ is a satisfiable Boolean formula}\}$. Show that $\mathit{SAT} \in \text{NP}$. Specifically, explain what a certificate is in this example, and estimate the running time of a verifier when the input formula $\langle \phi \rangle$ has $n$ variables.  

3. A *coloring* of a graph is an assignment of colors to its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Let $\mathit{3COLOR} = \{\langle G \rangle \mid G \text{ is colorable with 3 colors}\}$. Estimate the running time of a verifier when the input is a graph with $n$ vertices. Is $\mathit{3COLOR} \in \text{NP}$?

4. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`]  The following nondeterministic TM has two nondeterministic branches when executed on input $w = \mathtt{101}$. For each of these branches, draw the tableau whose rows are the configurations of the NTM, as in Figure 7.38 on page 305 (page 277 in the 2nd edition).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="4in"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/ntm5ipe.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

5. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] A *window* in a tableau is a $2\times 3$ rectangle of table cells. There are examples of "legal" windows on page 308 (p. 280 in 2/e). For the tableau in question 3 that represents the accepting branch, find legal windows that correspond to (a) a rightward tape move, (b) a leftward tape move, and (c) something else.
