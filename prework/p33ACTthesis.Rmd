## Prework 3.3a: The Church-Turing Thesis

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem on this sheet of paper (front and back). Use additional sheets if necessary. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. Define an encoding of the polynomial $Ax^2 +Bx +C$ (with coefficients $A, B, C \in \mathbb{Z}$) as a string in $(\mathtt{0}\cup \mathtt{1})^{|A|}\#(\mathtt{0}\cup \mathtt{1})^{|B|}\#(\mathtt{0}\cup \mathtt{1})^{|C|}$, where the $\mathtt{0}$’s and $\mathtt{1}$’s are chosen according to whether the corresponding coefficients are positive or negative. For example, $3x^2 - 4x + 2$ would encode as $\mathtt{000\#1111\#00}$. What polynomial is encoded as $\mathtt{0\#1\#111111}$? How would you encode the polynomial $x^2-4$?

2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`]   Give an implementation description of a TM (possibly multitape or nondeterministic) that decides the language of all strings of the form $\mathtt{0}^n\mathtt{\#}q$, where $q$ is an encoding of the quadratic polynomial $Ax^2 + Bx + C$ (as defined in Problem 1), and $n$ is a root of this polynomial (i.e., $An^2 + Bn + C = 0$).

3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] A \textit{two-stack pushdown automaton} is defined similarly to a regular PDA, except that two stacks are maintained and can be pushed/popped at each transition. In the state diagram, arrows are labeled as $x, (s_1, s_2) \rightarrow (t_1 , t_2)$ to indicate that $x$ is the input symbol being consumed, $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the stack symbols being popped from stack \#1 and stack \#2, respectively, and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the respective symbols to be pushed. Determine the language recognized by the following two-stack PDA. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="4.5in"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("../prework/images/twostackpda.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

4. Is the language recognized by the two-stack PDA in Problem 3 a context-free language? How do you know? What does this say about the computational power of two-stack PDA’s? 

5. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`]   Explain how to simulate a TM with a two-stack PDA. (For each type of transition of the TM (left or right), explain how the two stacks are managed in a way that is equivalent to writing on the TM's tape.)

6. Explain how to simulate a two-stack PDA with a TM.
