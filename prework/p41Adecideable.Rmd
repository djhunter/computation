## Prework 4.1a: Decidable Languages

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:4], sep = ',')`] Let $X_1 = \{\langle A \rangle \mid A \text{ is a DFA and } L(A) = \{\texttt{0}, \texttt{1}\}^\ast \}$. Show that $X_1$ is decidable.

2. [`r paste(fnames[5:8], sep = ',')`] Let $X_2 = \{\langle A, B\rangle \mid A,B \text{ are DFA's and } L(A) \subseteq L(B)\}$. Show that $X_2$ is decidable.

3. [`r paste(fnames[9:13], sep = ',')`] Consider the following grammar.
\begin{align*}
S & \rightarrow UV \\
V & \rightarrow VV \\
U & \rightarrow WU \\
U & \rightarrow \mathtt{a} \\
V & \rightarrow \mathtt{b} \\
W & \rightarrow \mathtt{c}
\end{align*}
    a. Explain why the derivation of any string of length $n$ derived by this grammar requires exactly $2n-1$ steps.
    b. Simplify the grammar into an equivalent grammar with as few rules as possible.
