## Prework 1.4c: Regular vs. Nonregular

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem on this sheet of paper (front and back). Use additional sheets if necessary. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] Let $A = \{\mathtt{0}^ku\mathtt{0}^k \mid k \geq 1 \text{ and } u \in \{\mathtt{0,1}\}^*\}$. Prove that $A$ is regular.

2. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] Let $B = \{\mathtt{0}^k\mathtt{1}u\mathtt{0}^k \mid k \geq 1 \text{ and } u \in \{\mathtt{0,1}\}^*\}$. Prove that $B$ is nonregular.

3. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] Let $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0,1}\}$. For each $k \geq 1$, let $C_k$ be the language consisting of all strings that contain a \texttt{0} exactly $k$ places from the right-hand end. Build a DFA that recognizes $C_k$. What is the fewest number of states required?

4. How could the solution to Problem 3 be different if $C_k$ were the language consisting of all strings that contain a \texttt{0} exactly $k$ places from the \textit{left}-hand end?

5.  Consider $\Sigma = \left\lbrace \frac{0}{0}, \frac{0}{1}, \frac{1}{0}, \frac{1}{1}  \right\rbrace$. A string in $\Sigma^\ast$ consists of a top binary string $t$ and a bottom binary string $b$ of equal lengths. For this problem, we regard $t$ and $b$ as numbers expressed in binary notation. Prove that the following language $F$ is regular.
$$
F = \left\{ w = \frac{t}{b} \in \Sigma^\ast \mid b = 3t \right\} 
$$
Hint: It might be easier to prove that $F^R$ is regular, and use closure.
