## Prework 2.2a: Pushdown Automata

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] Consider the following pushdown automaton (PDA) with input alphabet $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c}\}$ and stack alphabet $\Gamma = \{\mathtt{\$}, S\} \cup \Sigma$. Determine which of the strings $\mathtt{a}$, $\mathtt{aaa}$, $\mathtt{bac}$, $\mathtt{cab}$, $\mathtt{bbacc}$ it accepts.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="4in"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/pda3ipe.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

2. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the set of all palindromes in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$.

3. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the set of all strings in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$ that have the same number of $\mathtt{0}$'s as $\mathtt{1}$'s.

4. [`r paste(fnames[10:13], sep = ',')`] Let $A = \{\mathtt{a}^i\mathtt{b}^j\mathtt{c}^k \mid i = j \text{ or } j=k \text{ where } i,j,k\geq 0\}$. Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the language $A$.
