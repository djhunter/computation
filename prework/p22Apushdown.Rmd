## Prework 2.2a: Pushdown Automata

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem on this sheet of paper (front and back). Use additional sheets if necessary. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. Consider the following pushdown automaton (PDA) with input alphabet $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c}\}$ and stack alphabet $\Gamma = \{\mathtt{\$}, S\} \cup \Sigma$. Determine which of the strings $\mathtt{a}$, $\mathtt{aaa}$, $\mathtt{bac}$, $\mathtt{cab}$, $\mathtt{bbacc}$ it accepts.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="4in"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/pda3ipe.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the set of all palindromes in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$.

3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the set of all strings in $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$ that have the same number of $\mathtt{0}$'s as $\mathtt{1}$'s.

4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] Let $A = \{\mathtt{a}^i\mathtt{b}^j\mathtt{c}^k \mid i = j \text{ or } j=k \text{ where } i,j,k\geq 0\}$. Give a state diagram for a PDA that recognizes the language $A$.
