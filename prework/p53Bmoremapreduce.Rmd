## Prework 5.3b: Mapping reducibility and recognizability proofs

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem on this sheet of paper (front and back). Use additional sheets if necessary. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. Show that $\overline{E_\text{TM}}$ is recognizable by describing a TM that accepts $\langle M \rangle$ whenever $L(M) \neq \emptyset$. What does your TM do if $L(M) = \emptyset$?

2. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] Show that a language $A$ is recognizable if and only if $A \leq_\text{m} A_\text{TM}$.

3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] Let $J = \{w \mid w=\mathtt{0}x \text{ for some } x\in A_\text{TM}\text{, or } w=\mathtt{1}y \text{ for some } y \in \overline{A_\text{TM}}\}$.
    a. Show that $J$ is not recognizable by showing that $\overline{A_\text{TM}} \leq_\text{m} J$. 
    b. Show that $\overline{J}$ is not recognizable by showing that $A_\text{TM} \leq_\text{m} J$. 

4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] Let $J$ be as given in #3. Show that $J \leq_\text{m} \overline{J}$.

5. Let $X = \{\langle M, w\rangle \mid M \text{ is a single-tape TM that never writes over its input when computing on }w\}$. Suppose (to the contrary) that $D$ is a TM that decides $X$. Describe how to use $D$ to build a TM $E$ that decides $A_\text{TM}$. What does this prove about $X$?
