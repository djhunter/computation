## Prework 3.1a: Turing Machines

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem on this sheet of paper (front and back). Use additional sheets if necessary. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`]  Describe the sequence of configurations (states and tape) that the following TM takes while processing (a) the input string $\mathtt{10\#11}$, (b) the input string $\mathtt{10\#10}$, and (c) the input string $\mathtt{1\#1\#1}$.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="3in"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("../slides/images/tmM1.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

2. Give an implementation description of a TM for the language $A = \{\mathtt{a}^n\mathtt{b}^n\mathtt{c}^n \mid n\geq 1\}$.

3. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] Give a formal description (i.e., state diagram) of a TM for the language $A = \{\mathtt{a}^n\mathtt{b}^n\mathtt{c}^n \mid n\geq 1\}$.

4. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] Let $\Sigma = \{\mathtt{0}, \mathtt{1}\}$. Give an implementation description of a TM for the language $B$ consisting of all strings in $\Sigma^*$ that contain twice as many $\mathtt{0}$'s as $\mathtt{1}$'s.
