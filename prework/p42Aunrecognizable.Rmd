## Prework 4.2a: Uncountability and non-recognizable languages

Write your preliminary solutions to each problem and submit a PDF on Canvas. The names in brackets indicate the subset responsible for presenting the problem.

1. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of all infinite binary sequences. In class, we used a diagonalization argument to prove that $\mathcal{B}$ is uncountable. Let $\mathcal{B}_\text{F1}$ be the set of all infinite binary sequences with a finite number of $\mathtt{1}$'s.
    a. [`r paste(fnames[1:3], sep = ',')`] Explain where the diagonalization argument fails when applied to $\mathcal{B}_\text{F1}$.
    b. [`r paste(fnames[4:6], sep = ',')`] Prove that $\mathcal{B}_\text{F1}$ is, in fact, countable.

2. [`r paste(fnames[7:9], sep = ',')`] Let $A_\text{TM} = \{ \langle M, w\rangle \mid M \text{ is a TM that accepts } w\}$. Prove that $A_\text{TM}$ is recognizable by giving a description of a TM that recognizes it. Is your TM a decider? Explain why or why not.

3. [`r paste(fnames[10:13], sep = ',')`] Find a countably infinite collection of countably infinite disjoint subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. That is, give a description of an infinite sequence of subsets $X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots$ of natural numbers such that $X_i \cap X_j = \emptyset$ whenever $i\neq j$ and such that each $X_i$ is countably infinite.
